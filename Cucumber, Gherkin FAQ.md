**5 Best Practices for Feature Files**
1. Use descriptive and concise feature names: Choose a clear and meaningful name for your feature that accurately represents the functionality being tested.
2. Write scenarios using Gherkin syntax: Use Given-When-Then format to define the steps of your scenarios. Start with a Given step to set up the initial state, followed by a When step to describe the action being performed, and finally a Then step to define the expected outcome.
3. Keep scenarios independent and focused: Each scenario should test a specific behavior or functionality in isolation. Avoid creating scenarios that depend on the outcome of previous scenarios.
4. Use scenario outlines for data-driven testing: If you have multiple sets of test data to validate the same behavior, use scenario outlines to define a template scenario and provide different inputs using examples.
5. Use meaningful and readable step definitions: Write step definitions that are easy to understand and maintain. Use clear and descriptive names for your step definitions to improve readability.


**5 Best Practices for Step Definition Files**
1. **Keep It Simple**: Step definitions should be simple and clear. Avoid complex logic in your steps. If a step requires more complexity, consider breaking it down into multiple simpler steps.
2. **Reusability**: Write your step definitions so they can be reused across different scenarios. This reduces code duplication and makes your tests easier to maintain.
3. **Use Descriptive Names**: The names of your steps should clearly describe what they do. This makes your tests easier to read and understand.
4. **Parameterization**: Use parameters in step definitions whenever possible. This allows you to reuse the same step with different data.
5. **Organize Your Steps**: Group related steps into separate files or classes. This makes your step definitions easier to find and maintain.


**1) Can have multiple Scenario Outlines in the same feature file in WebDriverIO. :white_check_mark:
Here's a brief example to illustrate this:**

Feature: Multiple Scenario Outlines

  Background:
    Given I am on the homepage

  Scenario Outline: Scenario 1 - Check different elements
    When I check the element "<element>"
    Then the element should be visible

    Examples:
      | element   |
      | #header   |
      | #footer   |

  Scenario Outline: Scenario 2 - Search for different keywords
    When I enter the keyword "<keyword>" in the search box
    And I click the search button
    Then I should see the search results page

    Examples:
      | keyword   |
      | shoes     |
      | clothes   |
In this example:
- There are two Scenario Outlines (Scenario 1 and Scenario 2) within the same feature file.
- Each Scenario Outline has its own "Examples" table to define the data sets for that scenario.
This way, you can create and manage multiple Scenario Outlines in a single feature file while keeping your tests well-organized and easy to understand.


**2) You can use if-else statements in a step-definition file when working with WebdriverIO and TypeScript. Step definitions are just regular JavaScript/TypeScript functions, so you can use any control structures available in the language.
Here's an example of using an if-else statement in a step-definition file:**
typescript
import { Given, When, Then } from "@cucumber/cucumber";
import { expect } from "chai";

Given("I am on the home page", async function () {
  await browser.url("/");
});

When("I click on the {string} button", async function (buttonText: string) {
  const button = await $(`//*[text()='${buttonText}']`);
  await button.click();
});

Then("I should see the {string} message", async function (expectedMessage: string) {
  const actualMessage = await $("div.message").getText();

  if (expectedMessage === "Welcome") {
    expect(actualMessage).to.include(expectedMessage);
  } else {
    expect(actualMessage).not.to.include(expectedMessage);
  }
});
In this example, we're using an if-else statement inside the Then step definition to handle different expectations for the displayed message.
