**Hocks Defined:**
In the context of WebdriverIO hooks are special functions that can be run before or after certain operations during testing. They are useful for setting up preconditions and cleaning up after tests. For example, you might have a hook that runs before each test to set up the test environment or a hook that runs after each test to clean up any changes made during the test. However, if you meant something different by "hocks", please provide more context.



**Here's an example of how to configure package.json to run tests with multiple tags:**
json
{
  "name": "webdriverio-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "wdio wdio.conf.js --cucumberOpts.tagExpression='@tag1 and @tag2'"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    ...
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    ...
  }
}
