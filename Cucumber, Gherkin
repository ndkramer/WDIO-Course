Can have multiple Scenario Outlines in the same feature file in WebDriverIO. :white_check_mark:
Here's a brief example to illustrate this:

Feature: Multiple Scenario Outlines

  Background:
    Given I am on the homepage

  Scenario Outline: Scenario 1 - Check different elements
    When I check the element "<element>"
    Then the element should be visible

    Examples:
      | element   |
      | #header   |
      | #footer   |

  Scenario Outline: Scenario 2 - Search for different keywords
    When I enter the keyword "<keyword>" in the search box
    And I click the search button
    Then I should see the search results page

    Examples:
      | keyword   |
      | shoes     |
      | clothes   |
In this example:
- There are two Scenario Outlines (Scenario 1 and Scenario 2) within the same feature file.
- Each Scenario Outline has its own "Examples" table to define the data sets for that scenario.
This way, you can create and manage multiple Scenario Outlines in a single feature file while keeping your tests well-organized and easy to understand.
