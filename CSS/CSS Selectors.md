**5 Best Practices for Using CSS SELECTORS:**
1. A space should separate each element of a selector.
2. If a tag is present, it should be the first thing in each part of the selector.
3. If an ID is present and used, it should either immediately follow the tag, or be the first if no tag is present.
4. Choose the right CSS selectors - this can be complex as there's a lot of information out there.
5. Keep your selectors as simple and as short as possible to ensure they are easy to understand and maintain.
