# Top 10 things that a beginner should know if they are working with Typescript syntax?
1. TypeScript is a Superset of JavaScript: TypeScript includes everything that JavaScript does, but with additional features like static types, interfaces, and classes.
2. Static Typing: One of the main features of TypeScript is its support for static typing. This means you can declare the type of a variable, function parameters, and function return values.
3. Interfaces: TypeScript allows you to define complex types with interfaces. These can be used to type-check objects, function parameters, and class properties.
4. Classes and Object-Oriented Programming: TypeScript supports object-oriented programming and includes features like classes, inheritance, and access modifiers (public, private, protected).
5. Generics: TypeScript supports generics, which allow you to create reusable code that works with different types.
6. Modules: TypeScript supports modules, allowing you to organize your code into separate files and namespaces.
7. Decorators: TypeScript has support for decorators, which are a way to add annotations or modify classes, methods, and properties.
8. Type Inference: TypeScript can often infer the type of a variable based on its initial value, reducing the need to explicitly annotate your code.
9. Enums: TypeScript supports enumerated types (enums), which can be used to define a set of named constants.
10. Advanced Types: TypeScript includes advanced types like union types, intersection types, type guards, and mapped types, which allow for more flexible and powerful type-checking.

# Here are some key differences between TypeScript and JavaScript:
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means that it extends the capabilities of JavaScript by adding optional static typing and other features. TypeScript was developed by Microsoft to improve the development experience for large-scale applications and to provide better tooling and error checking.**

1. **Static typing**: :memo:
   - TypeScript allows you to declare variable types, making it easier to catch type-related errors before they occur during runtime.
   - JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variable types are determined at runtime.
2. **Class-based Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: :books:
   - TypeScript supports class-based OOP with inheritance, interfaces, and visibility modifiers like public, private, and protected.
   - While JavaScript also supports OOP through prototypes, it doesn't have native support for these additional features.
3. **Interfaces**: :handshake:
   - TypeScript introduces interfaces, which help define the structure of an object and ensure that specific properties or methods are present.
   - JavaScript doesn't have built-in support for interfaces.
4. **Type inference and type annotations**: :mag_right:
   - TypeScript can automatically infer types from the code and allows you to explicitly specify types using type annotations.
   - JavaScript doesn't have built-in support for type inference or type annotations.
5. **Compiler**: :hammer_and_wrench:
   - TypeScript has a compiler that compiles TypeScript code into plain JavaScript code.
   - JavaScript doesn't require a compiler.
6. **Tooling and IDE support**: :computer:
   - TypeScript provides better tooling and IDE support with features like autocomplete, refactoring, and error checking.
   - JavaScript has limited tooling and IDE support in comparison.
In summary, TypeScript enhances JavaScript by introducing optional static typing, better OOP support, interfaces, and improved tooling. This makes TypeScript more suitable for large-scale applications that require better error checking and maintainability.
  

**4) In TypeScript, there is no functional difference between single quotes (' ') and double quotes (” “). You can use them interchangeably to define string values. However, it's essential to maintain consistency
