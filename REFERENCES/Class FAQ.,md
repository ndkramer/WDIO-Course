Question I still don’t know what it is that I’m running, is this a Node application, Cucumber, Selenium, TextScript, all-of-the-above?

It sounds like you're running a test automation framework that could be considered "all of the above". Here's a breakdown:

1. **Node.js**: This is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It's likely being used to run your application.

2. **Cucumber**: This is a tool for running automated tests written in plain language. Because it's based on Behavior Driven Development (BDD) principles, the tests are often written to describe how the software should behave.

3. **WebdriverIO**: This is a custom implementation for selenium's W3C webdriver API. It's designed to work with modern web and mobile frameworks and is often used for end-to-end testing of web applications.

4. **TypeScript**: This is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types. It's designed to help catch mistakes early through a type checker and to make JavaScript development more efficient.

5. **Regular Expressions**: These are sequences of characters that form a search pattern. They can be used to perform 'search' or 'search and replace' operations on strings.

So, in summary, you're likely running a Node.js application that uses Cucumber for BDD testing, WebdriverIO for end-to-end testing, TypeScript for more efficient and error-free JavaScript development, and regular expressions for string manipulation tasks.
