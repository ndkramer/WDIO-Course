**Headless Defined:**

Running headless in the context of WebDriverIO, Cucumber, and TypeScript refers to running browser automation tests without the graphical user interface (GUI).

In a headless mode, everything happens in the background, and you won't see any browser opening up on your screen. This is particularly useful when you want to run tests on a server or a machine that doesn't have a display.
Headless browsers are faster and consume fewer resources than traditional GUI browsers, making them ideal for automation testing. They can perform all the normal browser operations, such as rendering HTML, executing JavaScript, handling cookies, and more.
In WebDriverIO, you can use headless browsers like Chrome Headless or PhantomJS for your testing. You need to configure your WebDriverIO settings to use these headless browsers.
