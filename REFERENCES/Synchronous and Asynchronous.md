**In programming, synchronous and asynchronous are two different ways of handling function execution.**

**1. Synchronous Calls:**
   In a synchronous operation, tasks are completed one at a time and in order. A new task can only start once the previous one has finished. This means that if a task is time-consuming, it will block the execution of the subsequent tasks until it's done, causing the program to pause or "hang".
   
**3. Asynchronous Calls:**
   On the other hand, asynchronous operations allow multiple tasks to be executed concurrently without waiting for each other to complete. If a task is time-consuming, it can run in the background while other tasks continue to execute. Once the time-consuming task is done, it can return its result. This makes the program more efficient as it doesn't have to wait for slow tasks to finish.
   
In the context of WebDriverIO, Cucumber, and TypeScript, these concepts are very important. 
WebDriverIO supports both synchronous and asynchronous modes, allowing you to choose the best approach for your test scenarios (however, the **latest versions of WebDriverIO only support Asynchronous Calls**)
Cucumber and TypeScript also support both synchronous and asynchronous operations, making them flexible for different testing needs.
